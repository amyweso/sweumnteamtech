# Final Code

## Setup
* The first signature is the sticker on the lefthand side of the head
* The second signature is the sticker on the righthand side of the head
* The third signature is the sticker that determines if the robot has docked

## To Do List
3. Come up with the distance for how close an object has to be to the mBot to get the robot to stop - line 90
4. Change the number of pixels the width of the docked signature should be in order to determine that the robot has been docked - line 123

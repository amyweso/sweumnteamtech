# Final Code

## Setup
* The first signature is the sticker on the lefthand side of the head
* The second signature is the sticker on the righthand side of the head
* The third signature is the sticker that determines if the robot has docked

## Ports
* The left motor is connected to port M1
* The right motor is connected to port M2
* The ultrasonic sensor is connected to port 2

# Final Code

## Setup
* The first signature is the sticker on the lefthand side of the head
* The second signature is the sticker on the righthand side of the head
* The third signature is the sticker that determines if the robot has docked

## To Do List
1. Implement pathBlocked() method using the sonar sensor that comes with the mBot
2. Change the motor pins on line 8 to be the correct pins on the mBot
3. Change the led_light on line 11 to be the correct LED pin on the mBot
4. Change line 118 so instead of 10.0 pixels, it is the number of pixels the width of the docked signature should be in order to determine that the robot has been docked.

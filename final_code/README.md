# Final Code

## Setup
* The first signature is the sticker on the lefthand side of the head
* The second signature is the sticker on the righthand side of the head
* The third signature is the sticker that determines if the robot has docked

## To Do List
1. Change the motor pins to be the correct pins on the mBot - line 18
2. Plug the ultrasonic sensor into port 3 - line 22
3. Change the led_light to be the correct LED pin on the mBot - line 25
4. Come up with the distance for how close an object has to be to the mBot to get the robot to stop - line 90
5. Change the number of pixels the width of the docked signature should be in order to determine that the robot has been docked - line 132
